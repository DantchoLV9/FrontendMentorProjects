## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

With this project I learned how to make better light & dark theme switching functionality.

### Continued development

While I did learn a better way of making a light & dark theme switching functionality, I would like to improve on that even more and make a version without the initial flash which appears before the theme is loaded.
