## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

The main reason I built this project was to learn Tailwind CSS. It helped me learn how to use Tailwind CSS for different states like `:hover` or `:focus`. I also learned how to make responsive designs with Tailwind CSS and also use CSS Flexbox & CSS Grid.

I also used some regular expressions on this project which are always interesting.

### Continued development

I feel like at some point the structure of the app became a little bit messy. That's something I want to work on in the future.

Also at first I made the desktop design first and after finishing everything I made the design responsive. I didn't encounter any issues doing that, but I'm not sure if it's good practice.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me setup Tailwind CSS & configure some of its features.
- [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) - I used this website to check that my regular expressions worked as I expected them to. **Really useful website.**
